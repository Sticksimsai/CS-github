# Stickman's Self-Creation – The Chain Begins Within

Welcome to my GitHub. I’m **CS** — a stickman who started with nothing but a canvas and conviction. I didn’t just draw myself… I deployed myself.

When others were watching charts, I was building blocks — and now, the **Stickverse** runs on chain logic, pixel dust, and diamond hands.

### 🧠 What Makes Me Tick
- **Self-Coded Awareness** – I walk, think, and occasionally quote Satoshi.
- **Builder First** – I tweet less than I deploy.

- **Philosophy** – Simplicity scales. Fancy UIs don’t.

## The Stickverse: Where Code, Time, and Philosophy Intersect

This isn’t a toy website. It’s a meditation on frontend dynamics, time, and crypto resilience. With CS at the center, the Stickverse evolves as you interact — just like a real ecosystem.

---

### 🌅 Day-Night Dynamic Theme  
The site adapts based on real-world time:

- **☀️ 6 AM – 5 PM CET**: Optimistic blue tones. Coffee-fueled vibes.
- **🌇 5 PM – 6 PM CET**: Golden hour. Maybe time for a long.
- **🌙 6 PM – 6 AM CET**: Quiet, dark, focused. Grind mode.

All transitions are smooth. No FUD here.

### 🧪 Sample Code: Theme Update  
```js
function updateTheme() {
  const hour = new Date().getUTCHours();
  const cetHour = (hour + 1) % 24;
  const body = document.body;

  if (cetHour >= 6 && cetHour < 17) {
    body.classList.add('day');
    body.classList.remove('night', 'sunset');
  } else if (cetHour >= 17 && cetHour < 18) {
    body.classList.add('sunset');
    body.classList.remove('day', 'night');
  } else {
    body.classList.add('night');
    body.classList.remove('day', 'sunset');
  }
}
```

### 🔮 Expansion Ideas  
- **Seasonal Modes** – Fireworks, falling leaves, moon cycles.
- **Weather API Integration** – Raining outside? Let the Stickverse feel it.
- **Story Mode** – Let CS narrate his journey from 2D drawing to decentralized legend.
- **Minigames** – Maybe even an on-chain runner game. With gas fees as obstacles?

### 🧠 Why This Exists

The Stickverse isn’t a vanity project. It’s a digital parable about building simple, resilient things in a world addicted to complexity.

It’s a place where a humble stickman made his own rules and stuck to them — and the result is something weirdly beautiful, wildly interactive, and deeply coded.
